// Accessing an array element is O(1) even If array is length of 10 000, it just gets the last 
// element easily there is shortcut

// Adding to an array is also constant O(1), It is easy to do.

// Problem is when we are adding at the beginning of an array
// To add smth at the front of array we have to reindex other elements as well 
// So it is gonna take time complexity of O(n)

// Also removing element at the top is the same as adding

// Searching is also O(n)
