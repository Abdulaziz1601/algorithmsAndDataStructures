// We gradually build up
// Sorted portion of the array
// By inserting one item at a time at the correct place

// Pseudocode

// We start by pciking the second element in the array
// Now compare the second element with the one before It and swap if necessary 
// Continue to the next element and check if It is in the correct order
// we iterate through the sorted portion (i.e the left side) to place the element in the correct place
// Repeat until array is sorted
