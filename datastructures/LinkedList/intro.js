// Datastucture that contains a head, tail, and length property
// Linked List consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

                    // Comparison with Arrays

// Lists 
    // Do not have indexes!
    // Connected via nodes with a next pointer
    // Random access is not allowed
    // To get to some linked list item you need to pass through previous items

// Arrays
    // Indexed in order!
    // Insertion and deletion can be expensive
    // Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
